#To compile and run the application the following steps need to be executed in the same location where the 'src' folder(with the source code) is:
#The "sub-scripts" mentioned may be changed according the needs
#By default these commands compile and start running 3 peers and one backup client

#Compiles the client and peer code
sh compile_all.sh

#Starts the RMI Registry(used in client-peer communication) in another terminal
sh rmi_linux.sh
#RMI Registry in Windows(the sleep is needed because when tested in windows the RMI Registry took some seconds to start working)
#sh rmi_windows.sh
#sleep 15

#Starts multiples peers at the same time
sh run.sh
#Starts only one peer
#sh peer.sh

#Multiples scripts to run the 5 possible clients(the sleep is needed to ensure the peers have started working)
sleep 4
sh backup.sh
#sh restore.sh
#sh delete.sh
#sh reclaim.sh
#sh state.sh
#java -classpath bin client.TestApp peer1 BACKUP test1.pdf 2
